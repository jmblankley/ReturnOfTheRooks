DEV LOG
-------
Day 1 (2/1/2023)
----------------
Initiliazed project. Wrote pseudocode.

Constrtucted main class. Construced an initBoard function to initialize the chess board. Constructed readGrid function to to take in fstream and iterate through an input file. Constructed fileRead() function to take user input to select a file. Construced a printGrid() function to print out the 2d array in the text file. 

Started working on functions to place rooks where they will not be able to be attacked. So far for this problem I have two boolean functions that will check every row and column in the 2d array. Still needs finished.

Stopping Point: Got most of canPlace() and solveBoard() started. Need to work out some kinks and get them functioning properly.
